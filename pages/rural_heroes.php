                        <p class="fs-4 textmute">As we continue to disrupt the norm and drive access to inclusive education in rural communities, we have learned that one of the most effective pathways of growth and sustainability is to multiply our vision by challenging young people to think innovatively and create sustainable solutions to local challenges in their communities.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4 textmute">This is because we have realized that we cannot revamp education in Nigeria alone and that humans are resources that are still under-utilized in driving effective change in Nigeria. </p>
                        <p class="fs-4 textmute">We equip young people on workplace skills needed to thrive in any environment such as  project management, community advocacy, effective communication, and social entrepreneurship. After which they are tasked to identify a challenge in their community and proffer solutions by implementing their own community development project.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4 textmute">In this way, young people are being empowered to find their individual and collective voices, take action, and are being transformed from victims of circumstances to leaders of movements.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4 textmute">What makes this project unique is how it redefines education beyond the confines of a classroom to becoming a tool for empowerment and liberation for many young people who have been deprived of that privilege due to the financial background of their parents.</p>
                        <p class="fs-4 textmute">Beyond this, through this project, we will be raising global leaders providing local solutions to daily challenges in the different villages in Ikorodu, because they, better than anyone truly understand the root cause of underdevelopment within the community.</p>
